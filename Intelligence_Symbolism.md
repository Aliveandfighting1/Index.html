# 🧠 Intelligence Symbolism in the Rarity Model

The Rarity Model distinguishes **two core forms of intelligence**:

- **Emotional Intelligence (EI)** – mastery of the self.
- **Social Intelligence (SI)** – mastery of interaction.

These are not soft skills. They are *operationalized disciplines*, used like tools — or weapons — by those rare enough to train them.

## 🧭 Internal Compass & External Map

**One navigates the world. The other navigates the self.**

- 🧭 **Emotional Intelligence (CBT)**: Your **inner compass** — detecting distortions, correcting emotional drift.
- 🗺️ **Social Intelligence**: Your **external map** — reading people, sensing dynamics, planning moves.

This metaphor speaks to **tactical navigation**, fitting a background in **field ops, recovery, and philosophical strategy**.  
The rare do not react blindly — they move with direction, aware of both terrain and internal coordinates.

## Offense/Defense of Intelligence

- 🗡️ **Social Intelligence** – the *outward blade*, honed for group dynamics, perception control, and relational navigation.
- 🛡️ **Emotional Intelligence** – the *inner shield*, forged through CBT, reflection, and disciplined thought correction.

These are not ornamental traits. They are **weapons of clarity** — not for domination, but for **precision, restraint, and relational mastery**.

🧬 *To master both is to embody the rarest kind of human: the one who leads both inside and out.*
