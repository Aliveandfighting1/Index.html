## 🔍 Comparative Analysis: The Rarity Model vs. Other Philosophical Systems

To demonstrate the originality of The Rarity Model, the following table provides a side-by-side comparison with key philosophical and psychological frameworks that may appear related. While there are thematic overlaps—such as virtue in Stoicism, meaning in Existentialism, and focus in Essentialism—The Rarity Model is a distinct, lived methodology grounded in adversity and forged through applied personal evolution. It introduces rarity as a central life value, not just as an abstract concept but as a practical, actionable path to mastery, emotional command, and legacy. Unlike traditional schools rooted in theory, The Rarity Model is an integrated system of daily action, warrior-spiritual ethics, and legacy-driven leadership.
